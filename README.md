## hw1
A* prunning:
Implement your own evaluation function, since mine is sucks.

## hw2
MCTS:
I'm particularly proud of my implementation for MCTS, achieving nearly the highest score in class without any special implementation.
Consider precomputing the direction table to potentially enhance performance.

## final
NegaScout, Star1, Transposition Table:
Note that there might be a critical implementation mistake in my transposition table, potentially causing a performance decrease of approximately 2%. I am unsure whether this is due to hash collisions or if there's an issue with maintaining return values.
Also, implement your own evaluation function, since mine is sucks.
